# RANSAC
- Random sample consensus (RANSAC) is an iterative method to estimate parameters of a mathematical model from a set of observed data that contains outliers,
- when outliers are to be accorded no influence on the values of the estimates.
- RANSAC uses repeated random sub-sampling. A basic assumption is that the data consists of "inliers", i.e., 
- data whose distribution can be explained by some set of model parameters, though may be subject to noise, and "outliers" which are data that do not fit the model

# Hough transform 
- The Hough transform is a feature extraction technique used in image analysis, computer vision, and digital image processing.
- The purpose of the technique is to find imperfect instances of objects within a certain class of shapes by a voting procedure.

# Circle Hough Transform 
- The circle Hough Transform (CHT) is a basic feature extraction technique used in digital image processing for detecting circles in imperfect images.
-  The circle candidates are produced by “voting” in the Hough parameter space and then selecting local maxima in an accumulator matrix.
