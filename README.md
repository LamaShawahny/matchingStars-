# Hough transform :
- The Hough transform is a feature extraction technique used in image analysis, computer vision, and digital image processing.
- The purpose of the technique is to find imperfect instances of objects within a certain class of shapes by a voting procedure.

# Circle Hough Transform 
- The circle Hough Transform (CHT) is a basic feature extraction technique used in digital image processing for detecting circles in imperfect images.
-  The circle candidates are produced by “voting” in the Hough parameter space and then selecting local maxima in an accumulator matrix.
